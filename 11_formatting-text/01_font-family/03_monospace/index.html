<p>The browser will select the first font on the list that is installed on the computer or that can be downloaded. Web authors should always add at least one generic family in a font-family list, since there's no guarantee that a specific font is installed on the computer or can be downloaded. The generic family lets the browser select an acceptable fallback font when needed. It is often convenient to use the shorthand property font to set font-size and other font related properties all at once. </p>
