<p>The text-indent property specifies the amount of indentation (empty space) should be left before lines of text in a block. By default, this controls the indentation of only the first formatted line of the block, but the hanging and each-line keywords can be used to change this behavior. Horizontal spacing is with respect to the left (or right, for right-to-left layout) edge of the containing block element's box.</p>
